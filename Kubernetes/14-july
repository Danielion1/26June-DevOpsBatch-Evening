In kubernetes the code is written in YAML

YAML : YAML aint a Markup language

The files in which we will write kubernetes code are called as Object definition file or Manifest files

These files will have extensions as .yml or .YAML

Yaml is not a programming language, it is not a scripting langauge

It is just a method of saving data in a file.
It is like JSON or XML.

How do we save data in YAML:

Syntax-

key: value

key is genrally provided to you by the tool
value is given by user or by tool
Indentation is important in YAML
YAML is declarative in nature.

We can save any kind of data like String, Integer, decimal value, date, boolean, alphanumerical value
Yaml file can start with --- and end with ... , however they are not mandatory to be use din YAML file
We cna validaye YAMl code written by us using YAML linit which is available online


Example 1: YAML code saving single value:

---
company: Edureka
Training: Devops
Trainer: Sonal Mittal
Timings: 8.30PM
Days: Weekdays
Hours: 36
...

Example 2: YAML code saving multiple values or list of values

---
company: Edureka
Trainings: 
  - Devops
  - AWS
  - Azure
  - GCP
Trainer: 
  - Sonal Mittal
  - Ravi
  - Preeti
  - Jack
Timings: ["8.30PM","7.00AM","8.00AM:]
Days: 
  - Weekdays
  - weekends
Hours: 36

example: saving the data as maps[set of key and value] in YAML

==================================

The 4 main section in kubernetes YAML file

kind: here we will give name of object that we ahve to create

apiVersion: this is a schema theat K8s will use to create above object

metadata: herr we give name and labels to the pods

spec: This is the most importat section of the file
Here we write the 
 - containerName
 - image
 - volume
 - resources

=====================================

Connect to the lab or GKE and execute below YAMls:
================================
Multi container POD

kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: multi-pod-2
 labels: # lables are used to group similar objects
  author: sonal
  app: nginx
spec:
 containers:
  - name: c1
    image: nginx
  - name: c2
    image: tomcat
  - name: c3
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["bash", "-c", "sleep 6000"]

==================================
# kubectl create -f <filename.yml>

# kubectl get pods
======================================
Deployment Object - example 1

kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
 name: deploy1
spec:
 replicas: 5
 selector:
  matchLabels:
   type: webserver
 template: #This section is pod template that replicaset uses to create pods
  metadata:
   labels:
    type: webserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: app
      image: leaddevops/kubeserve:v1
============================================
# kubectl create -f <filename.yml>

# kubectl get all
